# Master's Thesis: Analyzing and Predicting Customer Sentiment and Adoption of FinTech Banks in the Netherlands

This repository contains the code and data analysis associated with my Masterâ€™s thesis, submitted as part of the MSc Business Analytics & Management program at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. The thesis examines consumer adoption of FinTech banks in the Netherlands, with a particular focus on sentiment, trust, and behavioral motivations using advanced natural language processing and statistical modeling techniques.

## Thesis Summary

The thesis investigates the following core areas:

- Key emotional and rational themes underlying customer sentiment toward FinTech banks.
- Comparative analysis of user perceptions among traditional-only, FinTech-only, and hybrid banking customers.
- Predictors of adoption using survey-based trust scores and open-ended responses.
- Application of sentiment analysis and Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to triangulate insights from customer reviews, Reddit discussions, and survey data.

**Author:** Nadia Klomp  
**Program:** MSc Business Analytics & Management

**Date:** 15 June 2025

## Methodology

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Fine-tuned RoBERTa model used to classify sentiment in app store reviews and Reddit data.
- **Structural Topic Modeling (STM):** Applied in R to extract latent themes from textual data with sentiment and user type as covariates.
- **Survey Analysis:** Used to evaluate trust levels, demographic influences, and open-ended feedback across 224 Dutch respondents.
- **Mixed-Methods Design:** Integration of qualitative text analysis and quantitative survey data for richer insight.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook, Transformers, spaCy, NLTK)
- R (stm, tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Data sources: Public reviews (App Store, Google Play Store, Reddit) and primary survey data

## Key Findings

- Seamless user experience, low fees, and innovation drive positive sentiment toward FinTech banks.
- Traditional banks remain favored among older users due to trust and familiarity.
- Hybrid users represent a strategic segment who value both innovation and reliability.
- Personalized service and human interaction remain under-addressed needs in FinTech platforms.
